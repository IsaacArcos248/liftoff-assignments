# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My assignment will be a time-study tool. This will enable users to use a time clock to time workers from beginning to end, list their stop times, and totals. From there, there will be an option given to give you your average, your productivity per hour, etc. If possible, I will also be adding functionality to input an entire shift's work time, allowing time for lunch, breaks, and down time.
